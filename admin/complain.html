            <p class="card-text">
              Many hostel residents are experiencing frequent Wi-Fi
              connectivity problems. The inconsistent internet connection
              disrupts their ability to study, work, or relax with online
              entertainment. This issue has been ongoing for several weeks,
              causing frustration and inconvenience to the hostel community.

            <p class="card-text">
              Despite clear quiet hours policy, there have been recurrent
              disturbances during the night, with loud conversations, music,
              and other disruptive activities. This is affecting the quality
              of sleep and causing discomfort to those who need a peaceful
              environment to rest and prepare for the next day.

            <p class="card-text">
              Some common areas, bathrooms, and kitchens in the hostel have
              not been adequately cleaned or maintained. This is a major
              concern for the residents, as it not only affects their overall
              living conditions but also poses health risks. Proper cleaning
              schedules and maintenance are needed urgently.

            <p class="card-text">
              There have been reports of unauthorized individuals gaining
              access to the hostel premises, which raises concerns about the
              safety and security of residents. The malfunctioning of key card
              systems and ineffective security measures need to be addressed
              to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone residing in the
              hostel.
